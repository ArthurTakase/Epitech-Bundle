## About the project

This project aims to recreate the cross-platform video game R-Type with an online mutiplayer mode.
It required the implementation of a multithreaded server and a graphical client, using an engine of our own design.

- `Tools:`
  - Project made in `C++` version 20
  - use of the `SFML` graphical library to display game elements
  - Compiled with `CMake`, minimum version required : `3.17`
  - `Google Test` for unit tests
  - `Doxygen` for documentation
  - A `justfile` is provided to compile, run and test the project

- Some of the features we implemented:
  - A `multithreaded` server, to handle communication and game logic at the same time
  - A graphical client, to display the game and handle user input
  - A generic `Entity Component System` architecture and game engine
  - A encapsulated implementation of an `UDP socket`, compatible with Linux and Windows
  - A client-server communication protocol
