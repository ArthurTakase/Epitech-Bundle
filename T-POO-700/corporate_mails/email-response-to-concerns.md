## About the new attendance system

The attendance software development team has received your feedback and worked on the points you raised. New features will be added so that the application can be effective for everyone. Before we tell you what will be available, we'd like to answer some of your questions about the nature of the application.

First of all, this new system has been designed from the outset to be easy to use(<b>*</b>), even for those who are not used to this kind of application. Users are autonomous, and you are no longer directly dependent on your managers to clock in and out. Your personal data is not tracked, however, and remains confidential. As far as managers are concerned, this relieves them of a repetitive and time-consuming part of their work, enabling them to be more available to help employees in the day-to-day life of the company.

As for the new features, here they are. Managers will be able to transfer data from the old software to the new, have a view by team with a time stamp by team, as well as the option of using the application offline. Night shifts are now counted, to prevent multiple shifts being performed in succession. Overtime will be counted as such and paid accordingly. A button for contacting technical support has also been added, enabling anyone to request help at any time. 

#### Important

<b>*</b> A hand-crafted, dedicated tutorial has been created to assist new users. Please check it out before using the software for the first time. You'll find it under the <b>/docs</b> section.
